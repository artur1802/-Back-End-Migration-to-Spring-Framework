Legacy Back-End Migration to Spring Framework

Developed a modern back-end solution using Spring Initializr, integrating essential dependencies including Spring Data JPA, Rest Repositories, MySQL Driver, and Lombok, to replace a deprecated legacy system.

Created and organized packages for controllers, entities, DAOs, and services to structure the application efficiently, and implemented code for entities and repositories based on provided UML diagrams and requirements.

Designed and implemented service layers with purchase data classes and validation mechanisms to enforce input requirements from the Angular front-end, ensuring data integrity and application stability.

Configured and deployed a RESTful checkout controller to handle customer orders, and added cross-origin support to facilitate smooth interactions between front-end and back-end.
Programmatically added sample customer data to ensure persistent information across application restarts, and validated application functionality by executing a real-world order scenario.

Verified system integration and functionality by running end-to-end tests, capturing screenshots of successful data operations and database entries, and ensuring no network errors during interactions.
